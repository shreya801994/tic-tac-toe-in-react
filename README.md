**Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React**

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. This project was created as a fun way to practice fundamental React concepts, including components, state management with hooks (useState), and event handling.

Description

This is a simple, two-player implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The user interface is clean and minimalist, allowing players to easily take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The application dynamically detects win conditions, draws, and provides an option to reset the game at any time.

Technologies Used:

React

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML5 & CSS3

Features

Interactive 3x3 Grid: Click on any empty square to place your mark.

Two-Player Gameplay: Players alternate turns, starting with 'X'.

Win Detection: The game automatically detects and announces when a player wins by aligning three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Draw Detection: The game recognizes and announces a draw if the board is filled with no winner.

Reset Game: A "Reset" button to clear the board and start a new game.

Responsive Design: The layout is functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
