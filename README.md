**Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React**

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. This project was created as a fun way to practice fundamental React concepts, including components, state management with hooks (useState), and event handling.

Description

This is a simple, two-player implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The user interface is clean and minimalist, allowing players to easily take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The application dynamically detects win conditions, draws, and provides an option to reset the game at any time.

Technologies Used:

React

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML5 & CSS3

Features

Interactive 3x3 Grid: Click on any empty square to place your mark.

Two-Player Gameplay: Players alternate turns, starting with 'X'.

Win Detection: The game automatically detects and announces when a player wins by aligning three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Draw Detection: The game recognizes and announces a draw if the board is filled with no winner.

Reset Game: A "Reset" button to clear the board and start a new game.

Responsive Design: The layout is functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from nodejs.org.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)


Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo-name


Install NPM packages:

npm install


Run the application:

npm start


This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start: Runs the app in the development mode.

npm test: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.

npm run eject: Removes the single dependency and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project. Note: this is a one-way operation.

Future Improvements

[ ] Implement a simple AI for a single-player mode.

[ ] Add a scoreboard to track wins for 'X' and 'O'.

[ ] Allow players to choose their own markers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
